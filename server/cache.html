		 * Hash URLs
		 * =========
		 * If this is a purely client-side hosting environment, like
		 * S3 or GitHub pages, we'll need to use http://hash.urls#/like/this
		 * In that case, we need to catch requests for subdirectory paths
		 * and redirect them to http://our.domain:port_number/#pathname.
		 * This index.html file does that with the script below. It also
		 * may as well register a page load with Google Analytics for
		 * the original URL
